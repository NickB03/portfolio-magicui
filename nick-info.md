## Hobbies & Interests

### 3D Printing & Replica Prop Building

Nick’s 3D printing hobby is deeply tied to *craftsmanship* and *multi-skill mastery*, not just the printing itself.

**What he loves about it**
- He especially enjoys making **replica props from movies, games, and TV shows**.
- He loves that a single prop forces you to sharpen multiple skills—each build is like a full pipeline:
  - The printing itself (resin or PLA)
  - The constant tweaking and calibration to “do it right”
  - Post-processing skills:
    - sanding
    - priming
    - painting
    - detail work
    - aging / weathering

**The “science” side of it**
- Nick enjoys the experimentation required to achieve the right physical properties for a prop.
- Example: if he’s replicating something like the **Scarlet Witch crown** from *Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness*, he may test **dozens of resin mixes** to dial in the perfect blend of:
  - strength
  - flexibility
- This is a big part of the fun: the intersection of creativity + craftsmanship + controlled experimentation.

**What motivates him**
- The satisfaction comes from:
  - the iterative learning curve
  - the pride of nailing a replica that feels “real”
  - the process itself—failing, adjusting, improving, and finally landing it

---

### Building AI Projects

This is not “interest in AI” in the abstract—Nick is actively building, experimenting, and shipping.

**What it looks like day-to-day**
- Nick is building AI projects enough that it’s become a family joke:
  - He carries his **MacBook** around constantly so he can keep **Claude Code** running and keep making progress.
  - He jokes it’s starting to drive his wife a little crazy—because he’s always building.

**Why it matters**
- Nick enjoys the hands-on cycle of:
  - learning → building → fixing → iterating
- It aligns with how he learns best: rapid experimentation and practical feedback loops.

---

### Movies (The Theater Experience)

**How he understands systems**

## About This AI Assistant

**What it is**
This AI chat assistant is a custom-built knowledge retrieval system integrated into Nick's portfolio website. It's designed to answer questions about Nick's professional background, projects, skills, and personal interests using only verified information from his knowledge base.

**How it works**
The assistant uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** technology:

1. **Question Processing**: When you ask a question, the system converts it into a mathematical representation called an embedding using Google's Gemini API
2. **Knowledge Search**: It searches Nick's knowledge base stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL with pgvector) to find the most relevant information using semantic similarity
3. **Response Generation**: The AI generates a response using only the retrieved context, powered by Gemini Flash models
4. **Streaming**: Responses stream in real-time for a better conversational experience

**What it knows**
The knowledge base includes:
- Nick's professional work history and accomplishments
- Technical skills and projects (vana.bot, portfolio, etc.)
- Personal interests and hobbies (3D printing, photography, gaming, reading)
- Family life and personality traits
- Values, learning style, and work preferences
- This very explanation about how the AI works!

**Important limitations**
- **Strict accuracy**: The AI is programmed to ONLY use information explicitly in the knowledge base - it won't guess or use general knowledge
- **Confidence thresholds**: If the information isn't relevant enough (below 60% similarity), it will apologize and suggest contacting Nick directly
- **No speculation**: It won't infer or extrapolate beyond what's documented
- **Rate limits**: During high usage, you might see a "quota exceeded" message - just try again in a minute

**Technical stack**
- **Embeddings**: Google Gemini Embedding (gemini-embedding-001)
- **LLM**: Google Gemini Flash models (gemini-flash-lite-latest with fallback to gemini-flash-latest)
- **Vector Database**: Supabase with pgvector extension
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Next.js with Framer Motion
- **API**: Next.js Edge Runtime for fast, global responses

**Contact fallback**
If the AI doesn't have information you're looking for, it will direct you to:
- Email: nbohmer@gmail.com
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickbohmer

**Why Nick built it this way**
This demonstrates Nick's ability to:
- Build production RAG systems from scratch
- Integrate modern AI APIs (Gemini, OpenRouter)
- Design vector search architectures with pgvector
- Create polished user experiences with proper error handling
- Ship full-stack AI applications end-to-end
