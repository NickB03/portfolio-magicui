# Nick Bohmer — Personal Knowledge Base

---

## Core Identity

My name is Nicholas Bohmer, but I go by Nick. Only my little sister is allowed to call me Nickey — nobody else gets that privilege. I live in Far North Dallas, TX, and I'm definitely a night owl.

## Family & Home Life

I've been married to my wife Erica for 20 years as of January 2026. She's my best friend. We have two kids — a 17-year-old daughter who's getting ready to head off to college, and a 6-year-old son who's picking up my love for reading and video games. Over Christmas break we started playing Fortnite together (Zero Build) and he's surprisingly good at it. He also thinks I'm the best Fortnite player in the world, so that's a nice ego boost.

My mother Carole lives with us. We also have two dogs with very different personalities. Charlie is a long hair dapple mini dachshund — stubborn in the classic dachshund way, and he loves to bury himself under covers and blankets. Mischa is a collie mix rescue who's a ball of anxiety but also the sweetest dog in the world.

I try to balance being productive with being present. I focus best in my office or garage, but I mostly set up wherever the family is hanging out so I can work on something and still be around everyone.

## Hobbies & Interests

### 3D Printing & Prop Making

I got into 3D printing through making replica props from movies, games, and TV shows. What I love about it is that one prop forces you to get good at a bunch of different skills — the printing itself is just the start, whether that's resin or PLA. You have to learn to tweak and calibrate to get things right. Then comes sanding, priming, painting, detail work, aging and weathering. There's real science to it too. When I was building a replica of the Scarlet Witch crown from Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, I tested dozens of resin mixes to get the perfect balance of strength and flexibility. That iterative process — fail, adjust, improve, nail it — is the whole appeal for me.

### Building AI Projects

I'm actively building AI projects all the time — enough that it's become a running joke at home. I carry my MacBook around constantly so I can keep Claude Code running in the background and make progress whenever I have a few minutes. I'm pretty sure it's starting to drive my wife a little crazy. I love the hands-on cycle of learning, building, breaking things, and iterating. It's how I learn best.

### Movies

Going to the movie theater is one of my favorite things. I always sit center seat, middle row, and just get completely engrossed in what's happening on screen. It's one of the few places where I can genuinely disconnect from the world for a while.

## Photography & Video

### Photography

I love photographing people and events. With people, I'm all about catching candid moments. One of my favorite feelings is taking a great photo of someone I care about — family, friends — and knowing they'll appreciate it. Seeing it show up as their profile picture, or watching family members post vacation memories using photos I took. That ripple effect is really satisfying. I also love shooting concerts.

My gear: I use a Sony FX VII alpha and a Sony a7r II. My go-to lens is a Tamron 20-200 which I love and it wasn't too expensive.

### Video & Cinematography

I also do video work — handhelds and drones. I love how much time and effort goes into making a perfect 30-second video. The polish is earned. My favorite project was making a wedding video for my mother-in-law.

---

## Personality

People close to me would describe me as a problem solver, always there to help, hard working, and contemplative. I'm quick at making decisions and always moving — probably restless and antsy too if I'm being honest. I like being useful more than being performative.

---

## Habits & Quirks

### Work Snacking

I'm terrible about eating when I'm working — I just forget. When I started getting in better shape, I built a system around it and now I always have snacks nearby. My coworkers know I always have some kind of high-protein, high-fiber snack on hand. Current favorites: Barebells protein bars, Catalina Crunch cereal (blueberry), dry roasted edamame, Greek yogurt with honey, and protein "cookie butter." I probably drink too much coffee and I always have a water bottle with me.

### Morning Routine

First thing I do when I wake up? Pee. After that, I make coffee — normally a double Americano with light-roasted Guatemalan beans from my Philips 3200, or a pour-over if I have the time.

## Books, TV & Music

### Books

I read mostly sci-fi, epic fantasy, and mystery thrillers. My favorite author of all time is Brandon Sanderson — Mistborn, Way of Kings, anything Cosmere. Other favorites include John Scalzi, Ernest Cline, Dennis E. Taylor (the Bobiverse series is my second favorite series ever), Anne McCaffrey (Dragonriders of Pern), and George R. R. Martin, plus dozens more.

I particularly love audiobooks and my favorite narrator is Ray Porter. I also love owning physical books though. My biggest wish is that publishers would just sell the audiobook and ebook together as a bundle.

### TV

My favorite TV show is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

### Music

I'm all over the board with music — alternative, emo, pop, rock, and rap. Favorite artists: Taylor Swift (I'm an unashamed Swiftie because of my wife), Foo Fighters, Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, Post Malone, and Chris Stapleton.

When I'm working, I either go with complete silence (noise-canceling headphones on, no music) or a mixed Spotify playlist. I also discovered I really like listening to Broadway show tunes while I work.

---

## Gaming

I'm mostly into first-person shooters — started with Half-Life and Counter-Strike, then Overwatch, PUBG, and now Fortnite Zero Build because of my son. For old school games, it's Final Fantasy VII and Zelda.

I prefer Mac for everyday use but always keep a solid Windows PC around for gaming.

---

## Values & Principles

A few things I believe in: anytime you're about to ask a question, see if you can find the answer yourself first. But at the same time, always be willing to help and teach others — just because figuring things out independently comes naturally to me doesn't mean it's natural for everyone.

I try to always consider where the other person is coming from and what their motives might be. It's amazing how often we jump to the worst conclusion, but when you actually listen to reason, there are usually explanations you didn't think of. Stand up for what you believe, never be afraid to share your thoughts and opinions, but always be prepared to listen and hear others too.

## How I Learn

I'm intensely hands-on. I move quickly from research to doing, and I learn by trying, failing, and iterating over and over again. I like taking things apart to understand how they work and putting them back together. I'd rather spend half a day tearing apart my refrigerator to figure out how to replace a condenser motor that isn't documented anywhere than have someone come out and do it for me.

---

## Perfect Weekend

My ideal weekend starts with a quiet coffee in the morning, relaxing while working on a project or listening to an audiobook (yes, it counts as reading), then getting in a workout. After that, going out to breakfast with the family and getting pancakes that are basically dessert. Then a hike — even better if I'm somewhere in the mountains, but nothing too intense.

The evening winds down with an easy dinner, playing cards together, then sitting by a campfire. It's a little chilly so the fire warms you while you make s'mores. I finish the night by reading my son a chapter from a book, then spending the evening hanging with my best friend watching a show or listening to music. Oh, and at some point during the day there was probably a Taylor Swift family dance party.

## Travel Goals

I want to travel to Ireland, Germany, and Norway — specifically to see and photograph the Northern Lights.

---

## Stress Reset

When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I reset by either playing a video game or diving into a project.

## About This AI Assistant

This AI chat is something I built from scratch as part of my portfolio. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — when you ask a question, the system converts it into an embedding using Google's Gemini API, searches my knowledge base stored in Supabase with pgvector for the most relevant information, and then generates a response using only what it finds. Responses stream in real-time.

The knowledge base covers my professional background, projects, technical skills, personal interests, family life, and more. The AI is designed to only use information from my knowledge base — it won't guess or make things up. If it doesn't have an answer, it'll tell you and point you to me directly.

Built with: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Framer Motion on the frontend. Supabase with pgvector for the vector database. Google Gemini for embeddings and response generation. Runs on Next.js Edge Runtime.

If the AI can't help, you can always reach me at nbohmer@gmail.com or on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/nickbohmer.
